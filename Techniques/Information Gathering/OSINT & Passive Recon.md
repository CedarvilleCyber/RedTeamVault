[[Dig]] gives you a *lot* of information about domain names. It gives you their IP addresses, IPv6 addresses, MX (mail exchange server) addresses, and more. 

[[WHOIS]] is useful for finding spearphishing targets. It also identifies the nameservers associated with the domain name, and it tells you when the domain will expire.

DNSDumpster is a tool that enumerates subdomains for you. This broadens the attack surface quite significantly. It has quite a few additional passive recon capabilities, as well. I believe it's only an online tool (no CLI version, sadly) but I could be mistaken. You can learn more about it [here.](https://infosecwriteups.com/exploring-dnsdumpster-unveiling-the-secrets-of-domain-infrastructure-c716b5b8c4a5)

Also useful is the [[OSINT Framework]] for finding tooling to fit your needs. OSINT is a volatile science. Get your tooling as up-to-date and as shiny as possible.
