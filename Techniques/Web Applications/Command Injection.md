Command Injection occurs when a value from the user is used to execute a command on the server-side. If not properly checked and sanitized, it could be used to gain RCE on the web server. This is not unique to PHP, but exists in all server-side languages. 

| **Injection Operator** | **Injection Character** | **URL-Encoded Character** | **Executed Command**                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Semicolon              | `;`                     | `%3b`                     | Both                                       |
| New Line               | `\n`                    | `%0a`                     | Both                                       |
| Background             | `&`                     | `%26`                     | Both (second output generally shown first) |
| Pipe                   | `\|`                    | `%7c`                     | Both (only second output is shown)         |
| AND                    | `&&`                    | `%26%26`                  | Both (only if first succeeds)              |
| OR                     | `\|`                    | `%7c%7c`                  | Second (only if first fails)               |
| Sub-Shell              | ` `` `                  | `%60%60`                  | Both (Linux-only)                          |
| Sub-Shell              | `$()`                   | `%24%28%29`               | Both (Linux-only)                          |

File managers, anything returning command data, etc. are all good candidates for command injection vulnerabilities.

# Bypassing Filters
[[PayloadsAllTheThings]] is a great resource for methods of bypassing space filters, and many other injection techniques.  [[Bashfuscator]] is also a good resource for obfuscating bash injections. [[DOSfuscator]] is the Windows equivalent.
