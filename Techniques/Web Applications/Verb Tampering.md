HTTP Verbs are the "commands" sent to an HTTP server to perform different tasks.

| Verb      | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEAD`    | Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains theÂ `headers`, without the response body |
| `PUT`     | Writes the request payload to the specified location                                                |
| `DELETE`  | Deletes the resource at the specified location                                                      |
| `OPTIONS` | Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs                          |
| `PATCH`   | Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location                               |

If filters exist in the web server configuration, but fail to limit access via all HTTP verbs, and only requests with GET and POST, there exists an opening we can abuse.
