IDOR: Insecure Direct Object Reference. It's a type of access control vulnerability.

Tools:
- [[Burp Suite]]

This vulnerability occurs when a parameter is passed to the web server that is not checked once returned, and this parameter controls which of a list of options is returned to the user. 

`bank.com/user-information/1000` -> `bank.com/user-information/1001` 

In this example, using 1001 in place of 1000 (the original user ID), will return user 1001's data in a Direct Object Reference. This can happen in URL parameters, cookies, etc. If you are searching for non-sequential user ID's, use two accounts to test if they can reference data from each other.
