# Titling
For CPTC, the report must bear the name and logo of the organization, and it must not bear the name or logo of Cedarville or any related moniker. It should be titled with team number only. 

# Usage Statement and Legal Points
Add a statement on appropriate viewing and usage, and the limits of wh may see or use 

# Executive Summary

At the beginning, put a 1-2 paragraph explanation to the C-suite of why their infrastructure needs fixing. This should comunicate a monetary cost to not fixing the infrastructure and explain how to do so from their office. 

# Introduction
Explain the objectives, dates, and SOW of the test. This should communicate when you were there, what you where there to do, and what you were not there to do. RoEs and IP Scope can be included in brief form here. 

# Findings
A good rule of thumb is one finding per page, a table denoting what the vuln is, how serious it is, and where it is. No more than one finding should appear per page, but findings may take up more than one page in emergencies. Remediation steps should be in appendices, along with full walkthroughs and demonstrations. A location or link should be provided in the Findings page. Screenshots should be abundant, and sufficient to reproduce the entire attack, but a maximum of one should appear on the Findings page for the vulnerability. 

# Appendices
Appendices should contain the long-form explanations of each attack and attack path, methodologies, ATT&CK mapping (if applicable and time allows), OWASP number (if applicable and time allows), etc. All of the nitty gritty details should live here, and keep the main sections of the report clean and tidy. 

# Screenshots
Make all details legible, and add supporting notation as necessary. [[Greenshot]] is an excellent tool for this.
