This list is a starting point for your training. Don't expect to make it through everything on this list, and don't worry about working through it in a linear manner. Pick what you think is most interesting - working on things that interest you will help you keep up the training.

That being said, you should try to find a gap in our CPTC team's collective skillset, and train yourself so that you'll have the skills necessary to fill it.

## Learning Paths
The majority of the rooms in these paths are paywalled. 
### Junior Penetration Tester
I split up the path into free rooms and premium rooms (paywalled) so you can do the free rooms, then go back and do the premium rooms all at once. You won't need to pay for THM Premium for as long if you do it this way, but some of the rooms make more sense when done in the intended order, so use your best judgment.

### Red Teaming
This is a more advanced path. It would not be good preparation for CPTC, so I recommend steering clear of this one unless you're preparing for a red teaming job interview of some kind.
### Web Application Pentesting
### Offensive Pentesting
Kind of a redundant name, don't you think?
### CompTIA Pentest+

## Free THM Content
tryhackme.com/p/Tib3rius -  A lot of people use Tib3rius's rooms to study for the OSCP. 
### Ordered by Topic
I don't know how credible this individual is, but she put together a giant list of free rooms and THM CTFs sorted by topic: [What rooms should you do? A free guide for beginners](https://skerritt.blog/free-rooms/)
- Some of the links were broken, so if a link is missing, I likely removed it because it didn't work. I'll try to replace them if I can find comparable rooms. 
- I'll add to the list as I find useful free rooms, and I encourage you to do the same.
- Avoid making duplicates.

# Web Security Academy
This is a free training resource for web application exploitation. It's provided by PortSwigger, the company that created Burp Suite. 

I recommend checking out their [learning paths.](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths) PortSwigger recommends these four:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Authentication
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Business Logic Vulnerabilities

I think these paths would be very helpful as well:
- Server-side vulnerabilities 
	- This is an "apprentice" level path, meaning it's more accessible than the others.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery
# Miscellaneous
Open-Source Red Team Toolkit:
- https://github.com/infosecn1nja/Red-Teaming-Toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#Payload%20Development
### OffSec
Metasploit class: [https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/)
PEN-103 course: https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-103/
### Seed Labs
These are more useful if you want to go into tool dev.

- Buffer Overflow Attack
- Return-to-libc Attack and Return-Oriented Programming (**ROP**)
- Shellcode

>[!Note] Seed Labs
>These Seed Labs were developed by Wenliang Du. They're detailed in the third edition of his book "Computer & Internet Security," where he also explains the concepts behind the labs. We go through this book in Cyber Defense, so you should already have it if you've taken the class. If you don't have it, the write-up for each lab is available at the seed lab website here: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/
