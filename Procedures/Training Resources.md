This list is a starting point for your training. Don't expect to make it through everything on this list, and don't worry about working through it in a linear manner. Pick what you think is most interesting - working on things that interest you will help you keep up the training.

That being said, you should consider specializing in a specific area of pentesting, such as web application pentesting or Active Directory pentesting. Try to find a gap in our CPTC team's collective skillset, and train yourself so that you'll have the skills necessary to fill it.

>[!Note] Seed Labs
>These Seed Labs were developed by Wenliang Du. They're detailed in the third edition of his book "Computer & Internet Security," where he also explains the concepts behind the labs. We go through this book in Cyber Defense, so you should already have it if you've taken the class. If you don't have it, the write-up for each lab is available at the seed lab website here: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/

tryhackme.com/p/Tib3rius -  A lot of people use Tib3rius's rooms to study for the OSCP.

# TryHackMe
## Junior Penetration Tester
I split up the path into free rooms and premium rooms (paywalled) so you can do the free rooms, then go back and do the premium rooms all at once. You won't need to pay for THM Premium for as long if you do it this way.

### Junior Penetration Tester path timeline: (overestimates built in)

Intro to Cyber Security module: 25 + 25 + 30 (hour and a half)

Intro to Pentesting module: 30 + 30 (an hour)

Intro to Web Hacking: 35 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 60 + 30 + 30 + 20 + 30 (6 hours)

Burp Suite: 60 + 60 + 90 + 45 + 30 (5 and a half hours)

Network Security: 60 + 60 + 120 + 120 + 75 + 60 + 100 + 100 + 60 (13 hours)

Vulnerability Research: 20 + 20 + 20 (an hour)

Metasploit: 30 + 20 + 20 (an hour and a half)

Privilege Escalation: 60 + 50 + 60 (three and a half hours)

About 34 hours total, excluding the Intro to Cyber Security module. 

Pacing: just over two hours a week for a semester, which is about 20 minutes a day. Do half an hour a day to give yourself time to study during exam weeks.

## Red Teaming
## Web Application Pentesting
## Offensive Pentesting
Kind of a redundant name, don't you think?
## CompTIA Pentest+

## Free THM Content
### Ordered by Topic
I don't know how credible this individual is, but she put together a giant list of free rooms and THM CTFs sorted by topic: [What rooms should you do? A free guide for beginners](https://skerritt.blog/free-rooms/)
- Some of the links were broken, so if a link is missing, I likely removed it because it didn't work. I'll try to replace them if I can find comparable rooms. 
- I'll add to the list as I find useful free rooms, and I encourage you to do the same.
- Avoid making duplicates.
