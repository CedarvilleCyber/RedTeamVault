This list is a starting point for your training. Don't expect to make it through everything on this list, and don't worry about working through it in a linear manner. Pick what you think is most interesting - working on things that interest you will help you keep up the training.

That being said, you should consider specializing in a specific area of pentesting, such as web application pentesting or Active Directory pentesting. Try to find a gap in our CPTC team's collective skillset, and train yourself so that you'll have the skills necessary to fill it.
