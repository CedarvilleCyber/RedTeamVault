These are helpful offensive cyber resources and references. The goal is that when you have a question, you know *exactly* what sites to go to for the answer. You should heavily utilize these resources while training. 

# Primary Sources

# Windows
For Windows-specific resources.
## Kernel Exploits
https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability
- Look for RCE, then LPE
## Active Directory
https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/
- AD and internal pentests. It looks very detailed, and it seems to cover a *lot* of topics. I think it'll be a very good resource.
- It has some Red Team specific (i.e., RT **not** pentesting) tactics as well. 
https://wadcoms.github.io/
- Windows/AD Commands cheat sheet. It's formatted like GTFOBins and LOLBAS, so it's very user-friendly. 
https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/index.html
- Hacktricks AD methodology :)
# Specific Use Cases
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25639/how-to-automatically-record-all-your-terminal-sessions-with-script-utility

## HTB Resources
These resources provide incredibly helpful walkthroughs of HackTheBox machines. 
- [0xdf Hacks Stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/) - this is 0xdf's blog, where he puts all his HTB writeups. 
- [IppSec.rocks](https://ippsec.rocks/#) - this is IppSec's website. It allows you to search for topics (think services, tools, or techniques) and from there, it brings up a list of videos in which IppSec discusses that topic.
# Training Sources

A more in-depth hacking platform with advanced topics. More difficult, but more rewarding. 
## PortSwigger Academy
[PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths) is the best web exploitation training resource out there. No other training sources come close. Plus, PortSwigger Academy is free!

- and much more! I highly recommend it. 
## Assorted Materials
- [Vulnerability Research Course Materials](https://github.com/tj-oconnor/undergrad-vr)
- The [Malcore Malware Bible](bible.malcore.io) is a resource created to help people understand malware. This can be useful for reverse engineering and malware analysis, although it may no longer be available.
- The Game of Active Directory (GOAD) is very useful for learning Active Directory exploitation.
