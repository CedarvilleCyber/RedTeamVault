# Welcome to the CPTC Knowledge Vault!
Congratulations on taking another step to bettering your knowledge of penetration testing and offensive cyber! The vault is free for you to browse, and is structured as an interconnected web of knowledge, so deciding where to start can be overwhelming. Luckily, there are a few intended starting (and returning) points. 

Details of the checklist and TTPs used during the competition are in the [[CPTC Attacker Checklist]]. This resource can serve as an index for you to begin with before branching into more specific study.  

The folders can also help direct you. If you are searching for CU Cyber's resources as related to Password attacks or Pivoting, you will find them in the folder labeled "Techniques". If you are looking for a Metasploit cheatsheet you should start in "Tooling". 

Dull-colored links are incomplete. Please feel free to expand the knowledge base. 

Further we maintain an updated [[Glossary]] that should be referenced in case confusion arises

Happy Hacking!
