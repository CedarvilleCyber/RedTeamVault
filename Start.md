# Welcome to the CPTC Knowledge Vault!
Congratulations on taking another step to bettering your knowledge of penetration testing and offensive cyber! The vault is free for you to browse, and is structured as an interconnected web of knowledge, so deciding where to start can be overwhelming. Luckily, there are a few intended starting (and returning) points. 

This knowledge base is stored as an Obsidian vault. Obsidian can be acquired here for free: https://obsidian.md/. The CU team also uses the Git plugin for version control and to cleanly update notes as they are revised. 

Obsidian is a Markdown editor. A crash course in markdown can be found here: https://www.markdowntutorial.com. 

>[!note]
>Obsidian does not perfectly follow all markdown conventions. Feel free to ask any of your peers or just view the raw text of any note if any syntax confuses you. The raw text can be seen using "Source Mode", accessible from the menu in the upper right of the page. 

Details of the checklist and TTPs used during the competition are in the [[CPTC Attacker Checklist]]. This resource can serve as an index for you to begin with before branching into more specific study.  Looking for a more structured approach and external training? Try [[Training Resources]].

The folders can also help direct you. If you are searching for CU Cyber's resources as related to Password attacks or Pivoting, you will find them in the folder labeled "Techniques". If you are looking for a Metasploit cheatsheet you should start in "Tooling". 

Dull-colored links are incomplete. Please feel free to expand the knowledge base. 

Further we maintain an updated [[Glossary]] that should be referenced in case confusion arises.

I hope this vault can be of use to you, as that was always its intended purpose. Please continue to add to it and pass down ownership to keep us as operators continuing to grow in knowledge and competency. Pr 22:29

Happy Hacking!
