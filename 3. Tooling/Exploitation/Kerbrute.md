Kerbrute will perform guessing operations in an AD environment against a provided DC (Domain Controller).


>This tool uses [Kerberos Pre-Authentication](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Kerberos%20Pre-Authentication), which is a much faster and potentially stealthier way to perform password spraying. This method does not generate Windows event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625), or a logon failure which is often monitored for. The tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication to perform username enumeration. If the KDC responds with the error `PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN`, the username is invalid. Whenever the KDC prompts for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, this signals that the username exists, and the tool will mark it as valid.

^^If we are successful with this method during a penetration test, this can be an excellent recommendation to add to our report. (Enable Kerberos event logging! -> Specifically event ID 4768)

```shell
kerbrute userenum -d <DOMAIN> --dc <DC_IP> <wordlist> -o <output of valid users>

kerbrute passwordspray -d <DOMAIN> --dc <DC_IP> <usernames_list> <password>
