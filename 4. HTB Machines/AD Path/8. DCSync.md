^^ adunn has DCSync privileges in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain..

==What is DCSync?==: An attack that lets an attacker pose as a fellow domain controller, telling the target DC to sync to the attacker and thereby whereupon stealing the AD password database.

### To perform this attack:
1. You must have control over a user who has rights to perform domain replication

Cleartext password: 

proxyagent:CLEARTEXT:Pr0xy_ILFREIGHT!
syncron:CLEARTEXT:Mycleart3xtP@ss!

### Get users that have reversible encryption enabled:
```powershell-session

Get-ADUser -Filter 'userAccountControl -band 128'           -Properties userAccountControl

```
