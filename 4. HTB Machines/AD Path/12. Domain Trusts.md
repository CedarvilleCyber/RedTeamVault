> A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains and may allow either one-way or two-way (bidirectional) communication. An organization can create various types of trusts:

## Different types of trusts:
1. **Parent-child**: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain `corp.inlanefreight.local` could authenticate into the parent domain `inlanefreight.local`, and vice-versa.
2. **Cross-link**: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication

3. **Tree-root**: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.

#### Transitive Trusts:
Trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts.
```
if `Domain A` has a trust with `Domain B`, and `Domain B` has a `transitive` trust with `Domain C`, then `Domain A` will automatically trust `Domain C`.
```

#### Non-Transitive Trusts:
```
The child domain itself is the only one that is trusted. Nothing the child domain trusts additionally is trusted.
```

#### One-Way Trusts:
```
Users in a `trusted` domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa.
```

#### Bidirectional Trust:
```
A <-> B
```

"I have performed many penetration tests where this was the case: I was unable to find a foothold in the principal domain, but was able to find a flaw in a trusted domain which, in turn, gave me a foothold, or even full admin rights in the principal domain."
