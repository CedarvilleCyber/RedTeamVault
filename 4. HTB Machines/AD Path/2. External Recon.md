## Why perform external recon?
- Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
- Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

==Get the lay of the land!==

## What are we looking for? 
1. IP Space
2. Domain information: What are the subdomains and what kind of defenses?
3. Schema Format: 1. What is the password policy? 2. What is the username format? 
4. Data disclosure: Are there any sensitive files that are public?
5. Breach data: What info is already out there to help me?

## Where are we looking?
1. ASN / IP registrars: IANA, arin, BGP Toolkit
2. Domain: domaintools, PTRArchive, ICANN
3. Social Media: Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, news articles
4. Public-facing company website: "About us" and "Contact us"
5. Cloud: 
6. Breach data: HaveIBeenPwned, Dehashed (paid). We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.

==Why is it important to know a companies technologies?==
-> So that you don't go out of scope and attack someone else on accident

1. BGPToolkit

2. DNS: Are there additional subdomains the client did not mention? Can we test those too?

What we have for the test:
1. Custom pentest VM on the internal network
2. Windows domain-joined host where tools can be loaded into
3. Network range 172.16.5.0/23
4. Non-evasive testing
    

- # Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!
