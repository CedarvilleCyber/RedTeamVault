### Two types of ACLs:
1. Discretionary Access Control List (DACL): Who gets access to what
2. System access control list (SACL): ==what== gets logged

## Examples of Abuses:

	- ==Change a users password without knowing their password!==
- `Add Members` abused with `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `GenericAll` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword` or `Add-DomainGroupMember`
	- ==This one is big, allowing modification of group membership, change of passwords, or kerberoasting==
- `GenericWrite` abused with `Set-DomainObject`
- `WriteOwner` abused with `Set-DomainObjectOwner`
- `WriteDACL` abused with `Add-DomainObjectACL`
- `AllExtendedRights` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword` or `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `Addself` abused with `Add-DomainGroupMember`
