- Any domain user can request a Kerberos ticket for any service account in the same domain.
- Service accounts are often configured with weak passwords and are reused too often.
- **In order to conduct Kerberoasting**:
	1. Domain user credentials
	2. A shell in the context of a domain user
	3. A SYSTEM account
	4. Know who the domain controller is so we can query it

### Tools that can accomplish Kerberoasting:
-> Non-domain joined Linux host: *GetUserSPNs.py*
-> Windows: *setspn.exe, powershell, mimikatz*
-> From Windows: *Powerview, Rubeus*


## Windows:

#### Manual
1. Using `setspn.exe` you can see what accounts have SPNs available. 
2. Using PowerShell you can request the SPNs from specific accounts and *load them into memory*
3. After loading into memory Mimikatz can be used to extract the TGT/S and converted into a format that hashcat can use
4. Get cracking!

#### Automated:
==When completing options after `-` on the PowerShell command line, hitting TAB + SPACE will show options==
