==Reset OpenVPN==:
`sudo sed -i 's/udp/tcp/g; s/1337/443/g; s/tls-auth/tls-crypt/g' /etc/openvpn/*.conf; sudo systemctl restart openvpn`

1. As of the time of when this module was made, AD holds 43% of the market share of companies that use Identity and Access Management
2. Many CVEs come out each year.
3. AD's design (ease of management and use), make it incredibly hard to secure

#### Connecting via FreeRDP
We can connect via command line using the command:

```shell-session
DavidLamoreaux@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:<MS01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:Academy_student_AD!
```
#### Connecting via SSH
We can connect to the provided Parrot Linux attack host using the command, then enter the provided password when prompted.

```shell-session
DavidLamoreaux@htb[/htb]$ ssh htb-student@<ATTACK01 target IP>
```



- The tools necessary for the ==Windows== attack host, `MS01` are located in the `C:\Tools` directory.
- Tools on the ==Linux== attack host, `ATTACK01`, are either installed and added to the `htb-student` users' PATH or present in the `/opt` directory.
