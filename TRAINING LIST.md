This list is a starting point for your training. Don't expect to make it through everything on this list, and don't worry about working through it in a linear manner. Pick what you think is most interesting - working on things that interest you will help you keep up the training.

That being said, you should consider specializing in a specific area of pentesting, such as web application pentesting or Active Directory pentesting. Try to find a gap in our CPTC team's collective skillset, and train yourself so that you'll have the skills necessary to fill it.

>[!Note] Seed Labs
>These Seed Labs were developed by Wenliang Du. They're detailed in the third edition of his book "Computer & Internet Security," where he also explains the concepts behind the labs. We go through this book in Cyber Defense, so you should already have it if you've taken the class. If you don't have it, the write-up for each lab is available at the seed lab website here: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/
