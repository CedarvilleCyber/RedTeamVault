A red teamer's SIEM for providing alerting against blue team investigation of infrastructure, monitoring VirusTotal and other sites for our implants, and providing thorough logging of engagements for better reporting and understanding of the blue team's response, whether it was appropriate, and how they can do better next time. For adversarial operations, this helps to secure OPFOR infrastructure against discovery and keep tabs on blue team's knowledge and DCORA.

This is a significant infrastructure investment, and is far outside the scope of competition. There is basic support for [[Sliver C2]] but it primarily targets Cobalt Strike, PoshC2 and Outflank's own C2 solution.
