Install by downloading the Linux-Debian-amd64 architecture package (called 'deb' in the command below) and using

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <deb> 
```

Nessus scans take an inordinate amount of time. They find a significant number of vulnerabilities, but they take a VERY long time. Use this early if you plan to at all and get it out of the way quickly so results are actionable before the heat death of the universe. 

Once you've downloaded and installed it, you can run the following command to start Nessus:

```bash
systemctl start nessusd
```

Then, go to `https://localhost:8834`. There will most likely be a security warning - that's just because you haven't finished setting up Nessus yet. Continue past the security warning.

Now, choose "Register for Nessus Essentials" (the free version). Follow the directions on the screen to get an activation code. 

The plugins will take an INCREDIBLY long time to download, so you won't even be able to *start* a scan for a while. Run nmap in the meantime.
