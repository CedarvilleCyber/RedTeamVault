SearchSploit is a command line tool that is very helpful for looking up vulnerabilities for specific versions of software. It does this by querying a local copy of [[Exploit-DB]]. Using the code provided by Searchsploit requires precursory knowledge of [[Fixing Exploits]]. 

```shell
searchsploit <search term> # Query the database for a search term. Examples include 'searchsploit panos 10', etc...

searchsploit -x <exploit number> # Examine an exploit with less

searchsploit -m <exploit number> # Mirror the exploit to the working directory.

searchsploit -p <exploit number> # Get exploit info and copy path to clipboard
```

Does not contain everything, and is not the end all be all, but it is a massive database so it is a safe place to start. Many of these exploits are idiot-proofed to make sure script kiddies do not use them without proper caution and care. 

The [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) and [Exploit-DB](https://exploit-db.com/) are two vulnerability databases that could prove helpful. The [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://www.cve.org/) website will also be helpful in finding vulnerabilities. 

Rapid7 is a vulnerability and exploit database. It includes instructions for how to use its exploits with the Metasploit framework, which is handy. 

I recommend using SearchSploit first, since it's CLI and it's faster. 

Since SearchSploit uses exploitDB, the exploits and shellcodes it tells you about are located in the exploitDB directory. ExploitDB is typically located at `/usr/share/exploitDB`.
