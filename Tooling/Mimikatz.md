Mimikatz is a windows tool used to enumerate passwords and hashes from the Windows SAM, which can be acquired by Mimikatz or via a process dump by [[Procdump]] or in Task Manager. 

> [!danger] Detection Risk 
> Mimikatz is well signatured. This must be obfuscated or otherwise disguised before running, as with most tools. 

Mimikatz is run as an executable and prompts the user with a command line interface.
