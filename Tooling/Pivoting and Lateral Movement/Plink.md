Plink is a Windows SSH port-forwarding functionality cmdlet that ships with PuTTY. It allows Windows users to set up local port forwards via PuTTY's SSH implementation. Since SSH now ships with Windows (at long last), it is most likely functionally deprecated. It is possible that the port forwarding functionality is limited to the server instead of the default client, so if this becomes the case, Plink is available. It does not require local admin, and accepts the same syntax as SSH port forwards.
