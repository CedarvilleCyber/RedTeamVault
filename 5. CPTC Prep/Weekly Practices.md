During our practices, we will work through a HackTheBox machine together. I'll perform the exploitation on the TVs so we can all see what's going on. At each step, I'll rely on you all for the next command to run. This requires group participation, so if you have an idea, speak up and share it! 

The idea for this is that it'll be a more collaborative exercise and it'll help us share tradecraft more effectively. I recommend bringing your laptop and following along so you get hands on keyboard exploitation experience. 

When you recommend a tool to use or a command to run, there are a few things you should do.
- If it's a tool we haven't used together before (or one we use infrequently), give a quick summary of what the tool does. (Ex: "NetExec is a network exploitation tool used for enumerating services on Windows systems.")
- Recommend the relevant flags and/or syntax for the tool so everyone how to accomplish the task at hand.
- If the syntax is unusual, send the command in the Discord so the lead operator can visualize what you mean. That'll make it quicker and easier for him or her to issue commands. 

Additionally, each week we will have one individual serve as the group's scribe. This position will rotate every week. The scribe will record the commands we issue, the results of each command, and our overall methodology. This will train each team member to record their process, which will prepare them to write the CPTC pentest report.
